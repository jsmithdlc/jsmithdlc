Hi there ✌️ I'm **Javier Smith**, an ⚡Electrical Engineer⚡ by trade, but please don't ask me to check the wiring inside your house, 
might accidentally start a fire 🔥

- 🪅 My interests are mainly in the area of **Machine Learning** 📠 though I'm also into **Electronics** 💡 and **IoT** 🔗. I love working on projects that
involve a mix of these disciplines.
- 🥏 In my spare time you can find me hiking 🥾 (though sadly not enough of this lately), hanging out with friends 🍺, playing video games 👾 or reading a science fiction book 📖
- You can contact me via email

Cheers!
